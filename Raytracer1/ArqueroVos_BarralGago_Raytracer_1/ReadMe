--------------------------------------------------------MODIFICATIONS---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-sphere.cpp: 	filled the method: 		Hit Sphere::intersect(const Ray &ray) Calculated t and N with the general ecuation of the 							sphere and the intersection of a ray in a point.

-scene.cpp: 	added next methods: 		Color phongModel(Object *obj, Hit min_hit, const Ray &ray) Calculates phong illumination.
    						Color normalBuffer(Hit min_hit) Calculates normal buffer.
    						Color zBuffer(double t) Calculates zBuffer.

    						Color diffuse(Material *material, Triple N, Point hit) Calculates id.
    						Color specular(Material *material, Triple N, Triple V, Point hit) Calculates is.

	    	modificated next methods:   	Color Scene::trace(const Ray &ray) Chooses which method will be executed.
						void Scene::render(Image &img) Do a second loop if it is zbuffer method.


	    	added some variables to store max and min distance, render mode and a vector to store the distance for each pixel.


-raytracer.cpp	modificated next methods: 	Object* Raytracer::parseObject(const YAML::Node& node) Chooses the kind of figure it is been 							read.
						bool Raytracer::readScene(const std::string& inputFilename) Chooses kind of render mode 						(default=phong).

-plane.cpp: 	contains the same methods that sphere.cpp has. In this .cpp file it is calculated the intersection between a ray and a plane.
-triangle.cpp: 	contains the same methods that sphere.cpp has. In this .cpp file it is calculated the intersection between a ray and a triangle.


--------------------------------------------------------INSTRUCTIONS----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some indications to fill the new figures in a YAML file:
	
	-For a plane:		position: [x,y,z] A point in a plane.
  				normal: [x,y,z] The normal in the plane.

	-For a triangle: 	vertice1: [x,y,z] One vertice of a triangle.
  				vertice2: [x,y,z] One vertice of a triangle.
  				vertice3: [x,y,z] One vertice of a triangle.
